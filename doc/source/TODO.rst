#. **When drawing a clock edge, allow a choice for line style.**

    Rational: When rendering timing diagrams with asynchronous clocks clock
    edges from two unrealted clocks improve legibility 

#. **Derived clock with 50% duty cycle**
    when negedge has no timing significance, 50% duty cycle may not serve much
    pourpose in a timing diragram. However, DDR representation or other mixed
    signal interfaces, for example will be more meaningful with a 50% clock.
